# ILPv3

**This is a prototype. Nothing is finished and everything could change.**

An implementation of the Interledger Protocol V3.

See [./example.js](./example.js) for how to use it.

## TODOs

- [ ] Connector exchange rates
- [ ] Quoting
- [ ] Compatibility API (that mimicks the `ilp` module for ILPv1)
